# Bouncy Bot

Welcome to **Bouncy Bot** â€” an AI-powered dance sequence generator! This project extracts audio features from uploaded music, analyzes its characteristics, and generates a JSON dance sequence. It can also simulate video generation based on the audio and the choreography.

While we're excited about the possibilities, **video generation is still in progress**, and currently, only a limited set of dance genres can be selected.
